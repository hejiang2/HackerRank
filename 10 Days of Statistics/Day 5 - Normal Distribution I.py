# Create a function for integration
# Calculate the area underneath a curve for a finite interval
# One method to compute integrals approximately, that a computer can actually handle, is done by filling the area of interest with a user-defined amount of rectangles of equal width and variable height then summing up all of the rectangle's areas.
# The Midpoint Rule:
# Each rectangle out of "N" rectangles has to have an equal width, Î”x, but each nth rectangle cannot be the exact same: the varying factor is the height which varies as the function evaluated at a certain point. 
# The midpoint rule gets its name from the fact that you are evaluating the height of each rectangle as f(x_n), where "x_n" is the respective center-point of each rectangle, as apposed to the left or right of the rectangle. 
# Using the midpoint is like implementing an average which will make the approximation more accurate than if you were to use the right or left.
# The cumulative distribution function for a function with normal distribution is:
# phi(x) = 0.5 * (1 + erf((x - mu) / (sigma * 2 ** .5)))
# where erf is the error function:
# erf(z) = (2 / pi ** 0.5) * integration from 0 to 2 e ** (-x**2) dx

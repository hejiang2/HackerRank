The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 8 = 0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

Step 1: Rewrite the regression lines
y = -3/4x - 2
x = -3/4y - 7/4

Step 2: b = rho * sigma_y/sigma_x
-3/4 = rho * sigma_y/sigma_x (1)
-3/4 = rho * sigma_x/sigma_y (2)
(1) x (2):
9/16 = rho^2
rho = -3/4 as x and y are negatively correlated

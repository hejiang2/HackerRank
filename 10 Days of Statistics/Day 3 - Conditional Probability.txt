Bayes' Theorem:
Historical data shows that it has only rained 5 days per year in some desert region (assuming a 365 day year). A meteorologist predicts that it will rain today. When it actually rains, the meteorologist correctly predicts rain 98% of the time. When it doesn't rain, the meteorologist incorrectly predicts rain 10% of the time. Find the probability that it will rain today.

In this question, the probability of rain tomorrow depends on whether or not it rains today. We define the following events:

Event R: It rains today. P(R) = 5/365
Event R^C: It doesn't rain today. P(R^C) = 360/365
Event M: The meteorologist predicted it will rain today: P(M|R) = 9/10, P(M|R^C) = 1/10

P(R|M) = (P(R)*P(M|R)) / (P(R)*P(M|R) + P(R^C)P(M|R^C)) = 9/81

Task:

Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

Solution:
The question is asking if we know that at least one is a boy then what is the probability that they are both boys.
P = 1(BB)/3(BB,BG,GB)

P(B|A) = P(B AND A)/P(A)
Assume B: Both are boys, A: One is a Boy
We have to calculate P(B|A) so we need to know P(B AND A) and P(A).
P(A) = 3/4 ( since it can be BG, GB, BB out of 4 ) P(B AND A) = P(B) = 1/4.
Note that B is a subset of A so (B AND A) = B.

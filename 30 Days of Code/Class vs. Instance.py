# https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-class-variables/
# In Python, class variables are declared when a class is being constructed.
# This means that the class owns the variable—it is contained within the class—so all instances of the class will be able to access that variable. Class variables are shared by all instances that access the class.
# Instance variables, unlike class variables, are owned by an instance of a class.
# This means that the value of each instance variable can be different, whereas, in a class variable, the variable can only have one value that you assign when you declare the variable. Instance variables are declared inside a class method.
# In order to assign a value to these variables, we need to pass a set of values as parameters when we create an object instance of our class.
